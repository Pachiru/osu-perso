# osu! Mapping Olympiad

**osu! Mapping Olympiad** is an full-mode official contest line-up that was originally from a project of official beatmapping contests revival in 2018. Its particularity is to explore different contests concepts, going from traditional mapping contests to speedmapping or aspire, to mention just a few. 

This contest has its own rewarding system and works under a point system. Once a player reaches a specific milestone, they get rewarded with a badge, that can progress up to 5 times on every 6 points the player gets. 

The player will be given **6**, **4** or **2 points** depending on their place in a contest iteration, for the **top 3 entries respectively**, but the specific rewards may vary per contest based on expected effort and challenge for participants.
